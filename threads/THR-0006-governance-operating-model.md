# THR-0006 — Governance and Operating Model

## Summary
Design the Institute's governance structure, accountability lines, and delivery model — OSPO-style coordinator vs. delivery agency vs. standards body.

## Decisions
- **DEC-0005**: Governance model preference (needed)
- **DEC-0010**: Stakeholder engagement model (needed)

## Axes / dimensions
- **Role**: coordinator (catalytic) / implementer (delivery) / regulator (standards)
- **Accountability**: Scottish Government department / arm's-length body / hosted in existing agency
- **Funding**: core grant / project funding / cost recovery / mixed
- **Scope**: central government only / includes NHS / includes local authorities / includes education
- **Model reference**: Germany ZenDiS / France DINUM Pôle Open Source / Denmark OS2 / Wales CDPS

## Unknowns / questions
- Where does this sit organizationally? Digital Scotland? New entity?
- Who controls the budget? Who appoints leadership?
- What is the relationship to existing procurement functions?
- How does this interact with UK-wide initiatives (GDS, NHS England)?

## Evidence / sources
- `docs/GOALS.md` — mission and non-negotiables
- `docs/SCOPE.md` — governance in scope
- `research/2026-02-03-european-digital-sovereignty-policy-inventory.md`:
  - Germany: ZenDiS (Center for Digital Sovereignty) — coordination + platform
  - France: DINUM Pôle Open Source — central government OSPO
  - Denmark: OS2 — municipal collaboration, nonprofit governance
  - Wales: CDPS — convening role across public sector

## Governance model options

| Model | Description | Pros | Cons | Precedent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OSPO (Office)** | Small team, catalytic, standards + procurement guidance | Lean, flexible, non-threatening | Limited delivery power | France DINUM |
| **Centre of Excellence** | Expertise hub + implementation support | Can deliver directly | Higher headcount, competing with vendors | Germany ZenDiS |
| **Collaborative (OS2-style)** | Member-funded nonprofit, shared codebases | Sustainable, democratic | Slow decision-making, needs critical mass | Denmark OS2 |
| **Delivery Agency** | Full implementation authority | Maximum sovereignty leverage | Expensive, politically complex | None pure in open source |
| **Hybrid** | OSPO + designated delivery partners | Balance of coordination + delivery | Complex governance | Germany (ZenDiS + procurement) |

- [ ] Interview: Wales CDPS (comparable devolved nation)
- [ ] Interview: Denmark OS2 (collaborative model)
- [ ] Draft governance options paper
- [ ] Validate organizational options with legal/governance experts

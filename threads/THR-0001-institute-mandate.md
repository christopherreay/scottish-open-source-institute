# THR-0001 — Institute mandate + scope boundary

## Summary
Operational definition of the Scottish Open Source Institute's accountability: what it must deliver, what it explicitly won't do, and how to decide what belongs in "critical information flows."

## Decisions
- **DEC-0001**: Institute mandate and scope boundary (proposed)

## Axes / dimensions
- Governance: operating model vs. delivery model
- Scope: critical vs. non-critical flows
- Sovereignty: operational capability vs. slogan
- Delivery: standards/architecture vs. implementation

## Unknowns / questions
- What specific capabilities satisfy "continuity-critical" threshold?
- How to measure "sovereignty-relevant dependency" quantitatively?
- What procurement levers exist for the Institute to influence?

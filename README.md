# Scottish Open Source Institute — Proposal

This repo contains the working materials for a **costed proposal** for a Scottish Open Source Institute.

The initial mandate under discussion: help Scotland achieve practical sovereignty over the information flows required for:
- government function
- basic civil needs / continuity of services

## Navigation
- `docs/GOALS.md` — mission + non-negotiables
- `docs/SCOPE.md` — in/out + phases
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — living notes / architecture options
- `research/LOG.md` — append-only research log
- `decisions/` — decision nodes (stable ids)
- `ops/INDEX.md` — repo context entrypoint

## Workflow
- Use GitHub Issues for epics/tasks; reference issue numbers in commits.
- Keep decisions in `decisions/` and link them from issues/PRs.

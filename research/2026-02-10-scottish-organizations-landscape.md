# Scottish Digital Sovereignty: Organizations Landscape

- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Purpose:** Map existing Scottish organizations working on digital sovereignty, open source, and cyber resilience to identify gaps the Institute would fill

---

## Executive Summary

Scotland has **fragmented digital sovereignty capabilities** spread across multiple organizations. No single entity owns the full mandate. The Scottish Open Source Institute would fill a critical coordination gap between:

- **Scottish Government** (policy, procurement) — no dedicated open source/souvereignty body
- **Cyber Scotland Partnership** (cyber resilience) — reactive security focus, not proactive sovereignty
- **Individual councils/universities** — isolated initiatives without coordination
- **Private sector** (CodeBase, tech firms) — commercial focus, limited public sector integration

**Key finding:** Scotland lacks an equivalent to Denmark's OS2, Wales's CDPS, or Estonia's RIA. The Institute would be the first dedicated sovereign digital capability body.

## Scottish Government Bodies

### Digital Directorate
- **Role:** Scottish Government digital strategy, broadband delivery, public service digital foundations
- **Sovereignty relevance:** MEDIUM — sets policy but no dedicated sovereignty function; manages Digital Scotland Service Manual
- **Gaps:** No open source mandate; procurement levers underutilized for sovereignty
- **Key contact:** Director of Digital
- **Relationship to Institute:** Would be primary government stakeholder

### Cyber Scotland Partnership
- **Role:** Coordinating body for cyber resilience across public sector, private sector, academia
- **Members:** Scottish Government, Police Scotland, NCSC, Scottish Enterprise, SDS, universities
- **Sovereignty relevance:** MEDIUM-HIGH — focuses on resilience but not sovereignty per se
- **Recent work:** Strategic Framework for a Cyber Resilient Scotland 2025-2030; new "cyber observatory" announced Nov 2025
- **Gaps:** Reactive/incident-focused; no strategic sovereignty planning; no open source coordination
- **Relationship to Institute:** Potential collaboration partner; cyber observatory could feed into sovereignty observatory

### SC3 (Scottish Cyber Coordination Centre)

### Individual Council Initiatives
- **Glasgow:** Smart city initiatives, some open data

## Academic/Research

### University of Edinburgh / Bayes Centre

### University of Strathclyde / National Manufacturing Institute Scotland
- **Role:** Manufacturing, supply chain, cyber-physical systems
- **Sovereignty relevance:** MEDIUM — industrial control system security
- **Relationship to Institute:** SCADA/ICS sovereignty research

### Scottish Universities Cyber-Security Research Consortium
- **Role:** Academic cyber security research coordination

## Regulatory/Standards (UK-wide with Scottish presence)

### NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre)
- **Role:** UK technical authority on cyber security
- **Sovereignty relevance:** MEDIUM — security guidance but not sovereignty strategy
- **Scottish interface:** Provides services to Scottish Government but no directive authority
- **Gaps:** No devolution-specific guidance; no Scottish policy input mechanism
- **Relationship to Institute:** Technical authority partner; not a substitute

### Police Scotland
- **Role:** Law enforcement; Digital Evidence Sharing Capability on Azure

## The Gap Analysis: What Doesn't Exist

| Capability | Denmark | Wales | Scotland | Institute Role |
|------------|---------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Municipal open source collaboration** | OS2 (82/98 councils, 84%) | — | ❌ None | Scottish OS2 equivalent |
| **Arm's-length digital transformation body** | — | CDPS (29 staff) | ❌ None | Direct equivalent |
| **National e-ID infrastructure** | MitID (96.6%) | — | ❌ myaccount only (59%) | Identity workstream |
| **Sovereign cloud platform** | — | — | ❌ AWS/Azure dependent | Scottish Gov Cloud |
| **Open source mandate/legal framework** | ✓ (procurement) | — | ❌ Voluntary only | EMBAG-equivalent advocacy |
| **Data embassy capability** | — | — | ❌ None | Long-term capability |
| **Digital sovereignty observatory** | — | — | ❌ Cyber observatory announced (reactive) | Proactive sovereignty monitoring |

## Conclusion: Institute Positioning

The Scottish Open Source Institute would fill a **unique and unoccupied niche**:

1. **No existing body owns sovereign digital capability** — Cyber Scotland focuses on security incidents, not infrastructure independence
2. **No municipal coordination mechanism** — 32 councils act independently; no OS2 equivalent
3. **No arm's-length digital transformation body** — Unlike Wales's CDPS, Scotland lacks dedicated capacity
4. **No open source mandate** — Unlike Germany/Switzerland/Italy, no legal or procurement requirement
5. **No sovereign cloud** — NHS, Police, Government all dependent on US hyperscalers

**The Institute's unique value proposition:**
- Coordinate fragmented existing efforts
- Provide sovereign capability that no single organization can build alone
- Advocate for procurement and policy changes within devolution constraints
- Build indigenous open source capacity to reduce dependency
- Create the "necessary preconditions" for other organizations to act sovereign

**Organizational model recommendation:**
Arm's-length body (like Wales CDPS) with:
- Core funding from Scottish Government
- Council membership/participation (OS2 model)
- University research partnerships
- Industry collaboration (not domination)
- International partnerships (Nordic, Estonia, Wales)

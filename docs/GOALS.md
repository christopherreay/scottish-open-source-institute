# GOALS — Scottish Open Source Institute (Proposal)

## Mission (draft)
Produce a costed, phased proposal for a Scottish Open Source Institute whose initial mandate is to improve Scotland’s practical sovereignty over critical information flows needed for government and basic civil continuity.

## Non-negotiables (draft)
- Treat “sovereignty” as an operational capability, not a slogan.
- Prefer open architectures and open standards; use open source where it materially reduces dependence and improves auditability.
- Minimize single-vendor and single-jurisdiction dependency for critical paths.
- Plan for failure: offline/partitioned operation, degraded modes, incident response.

## Definitions (draft)
- **Sovereignty**: the ability to operate and recover critical information flows without coercive external dependence.
- **Critical information flow**: information required for continuity of government and basic civil needs (identity, messaging, DNS/time/PKI, incident comms, etc.).

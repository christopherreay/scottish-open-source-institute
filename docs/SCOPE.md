# SCOPE — Scottish Open Source Institute (Proposal)

## In scope (draft)
- Define the problem space: what information flows are critical for Scottish government + civil continuity.
- Threat model + dependency mapping (where feasible from public sources).
- Architecture options: minimal viable sovereign baseline + phased roadmap.
- Governance and operating model for the institute.
- Cost model (capex/opex/headcount) with scenario ranges.

## Out of scope (draft)
- Detailed implementation plans for every subsystem (beyond what is needed for a credible costed proposal).
- Offensive security / military operations.

## Phases (draft)
- Phase 0: terminology, scope, threat model, dependency map.
- Phase 1: minimal viable sovereign baseline (define + cost).
- Phase 2: capability expansion roadmap.
